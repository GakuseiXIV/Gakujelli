<p align="center"/>A Minecraft mod with no specific theme, targeted for JDSMP.</p>

## Features
### Guts
Guts is a feature in many fighting games that reduces the damage a player takes when their health is lower. The same feature has been added here, with a Guts potion to increase the effects of Guts (made with a thick potion and raw gold).
### New Potions
There are new potions added, those being Guts and Vulnerability. Vulnerability directly increases the damage taken by an entity, and Guts reduces the damage taken by an entity depending on its current health.
### (WIP) Perks
A WIP. Perks will allow a player to unlock new bonuses. This feature will (hopefully) be data-driven so that it is easy to make custom perks with this mod's framework.
